&lt;p>Hi folks, Snowy here! Sorry, it’s taken a good while to complete the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you may remember, I came into Guardian Angels care with a huge injury to my neck, which proved very difficult to heal. GA would like to make a special mention of thanks to the Vets in Old Isleworth
for their dedication and care to Snowy during his protracted treatment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After all my treatment and several months ago now, I was adopted by a wonderful older gentleman and as you can see by the photos my neck has completely healed and I am very content and settled in my
new home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Guardian Angels would like to wish Snowy and his new owner a long and happy life together.&lt;/p>
