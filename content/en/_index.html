Some of you will have noticed that not many animals are appearing on the Adoption pages, but a lot have popped up in the Rehomed section.
This is because we've radically had to change the way we operate during the ongoing Covid lockdown situation.
We still have to assess suitable homes, but in a socially distant and responsible way, allowing us to continue operating. <p/> <p/>
We hope to be able to begin publishing details of animals needing homes here again soon, watch this space and keep an eye on our Blog pages too for other interesting articles.<p/> <p/>
If you'd like to help us continue to provide for animals we are taking into foster care, you can donate below - we always appreciate any help we can get. <p/> <p/>

It's worth noting that there are also links to the other, larger charities on our Links page, which may be able to help if you have additional needs.

Do you have a large out-building, stables or farmland that requires natural pest control? <br/>
If so, we have feral cats waiting to find safe havens.<br/>
We trap, neuter, flea and worm protect the cats before re-locating them (in pairs or more) to their new environment.
The cats would need to be kept enclosed for several weeks until they adjust to their new surroundings.
A sheltered large dog crate would be ideal for this temporary set-up complete with their food, water, litter-tray and bedding..and once they are allowed out they could use the dog crate to return to with cosy blankets inside for when they want to keep warm.
If you are able to help our feral population please contact us via email at guardianangelanimals@outlook.com

Guardian Angels Animal Support is a strictly non-profit animal rescue and re-homing organisation run entirely by volunteers working within the London Borough of Hounslow and surrounding areas.

Our main focus is to offer help and support to animals, including (but absolutely not limited to) those that have been abandoned, are elderly, have health problems, and/or those with special needs.

With your kindness and generosity, you will make every difference in allowing us to help them.

All funds raised go directly towards helping the animals!
We do our very best to keep the website up to date.
This is done entirely by volunteers who both care for the animals and work on a full-time basis outside of the charity.
We are a non-profit organisation registered with HSBC Bank.
