Hi folks, Snowy here! Sorry, itâ€™s taken a good while to complete the story.

As you may remember, I came into Guardian Angels care with a huge injury to my neck, which proved very difficult to heal. GA would like to make a special mention of thanks to the Vets in Old Isleworth
for their dedication and care to Snowy during his protracted treatment.

After all my treatment and several months ago now, I was adopted by a wonderful older gentleman and as you can see by the photos my neck has completely healed and I am very content and settled in my
new home.

Guardian Angels would like to wish Snowy and his new owner a long and happy life together.
