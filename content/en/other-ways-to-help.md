title: "Other Ways To Help"
---

Whilst you are out shopping today, please spare a thought for the cats and dogs in our care waiting to be re-homed, and those that are resident and unable to find a forever home due to their age or medical needs. These animals will receive care for the rest of their lives by our dedicated foster carers who receive absolutely no payment for their wonderful work.

As we are a very small non-profit organisation run entirely by volunteers, our biggest expense after vet bills is feeding the animals in our care. If you can donate something as small as a can or two of pet food, a small bag of treats, or anything you think might help today, you will be making a HUGE difference and we will be eternally grateful for your kindness and generosity.

Please drop us an e-mail or give us a call and we will arrange collection of anything you can provide to help.
Thank you.

**Foster Homes:**  
Foster homes are always needed for the animals in our care. If you can give a temporary, loving home to an unwanted animal, please call 08447452122 or send us an e-mail at guardianangelanimals@outlook.com.

Full support will be given.
