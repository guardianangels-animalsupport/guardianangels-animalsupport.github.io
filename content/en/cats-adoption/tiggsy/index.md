**AGE**: ~ 3 years

Meet Tiggsy2.

I was a stray and have been in my foster home for around 3 months. I'm getting more confident and playful by the day.

Although I'm not a lap cat yet, given time I may decide to sit next to my new owner or on their bed. I love being scratched behind my ears and tummy rubs.

My favourite toys are a stuffed mouse and ribbon on a rod. I'm fine with other cats, but haven't been around children or dogs yet. Iâ€™d suit a quiet home as I'm still a bit wary and learning to trust.

I have had my vaccinations and I'm microchipped and I'm ready for my new adventures
