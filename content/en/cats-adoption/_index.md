<p align="center"> Please note that our adoption donation fee is Â£95.00 and is payable per animal.
If you are interested in any of our cats, please complete the Homing Questionnaire which is available <a href="/homing_questionnaire__cat.pdf">HERE</a>

This adoption fee helps to cover expenses for things such as neutering, vaccinations, micro-chipping, flea and worm treatment, as well as full veterinary health checks prior to adoption. As well as the cost of food, cat litter, and (if necessary) medication for ongoing conditions - these are our biggest expenses. We receive a very slight reduction in our veterinary bills, the payment for which comes out of our own pocket. We do not make a profit; everything we make goes towards helping the animals in our care. If you were to buy an animal from a pet shop, you would easily pay more than that for the animal alone, and you would then have to pay even more on top of that for the aforementioned treatments.
