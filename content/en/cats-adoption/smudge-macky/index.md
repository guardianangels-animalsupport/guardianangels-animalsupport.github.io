**AGE**: ~15 months

Hi I’m Smudge (B) and my brother is called Macky (B&W).

We were both a little shy to begin with, I can be scared of my own shadow sometimes! But once we get to know you (it only took me 2 days to let my foster parents stroke me) we will be all over you like a rash. Well Smudge will as he will sit on your chest but the way to my heart will be through my stomach! Yes I lurve food especially tuna!, I don’t gorge but do love a treat!

We DO NOT like sudden movements at all or being stood over, if this happens we run and hide but if you take it gently with us we will love you to the end, my brother Macky will even let you pick him up but I’m not there yet. We do not like collars either, our lovely daddy who had to give us up due to work commitments tried them on us and we hated it and sulked for ages!!

We both love tummy tickles, yes I know unusual for cats hey? Macky will purr lots when being fussed but I haven't found my voice yet. I love it when my brother grooms me and would struggle without him being with me, he gives me confidence and security I crave.

Even though we are very close we are chalk and cheese, I would rather be a house cat because of my trauma being circled by foxes outside 4 months ago but my brother Macky wants to be out and about exploring. I love playing with my humans when they dangle toys for me and I run after them but boring Macky just lies around watching!!

We are not sure whether we like dogs, we are in a home with barking dogs and don't mind the noise, but haven't been introduced to them yet, our foster parents will start our rehab with their dogs in a couple of weeks’ time.
